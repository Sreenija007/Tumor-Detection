# Tumor-Detection  

This project uses the Random Forest Classifier to detect tumors based on medical dataset features. It includes data preprocessing, correlation analysis, and classification to predict malignancy.

Features:
Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Correlation matrix, feature selection.

Model Training: Using RandomForestClassifier with train-test split.

Evaluation: Accuracy score calculation and model performance analysis.

Dataset: Real-world tumor data
